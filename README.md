Choosing who to vote for during an election can be a tedious activity due to lack of reliable information. 
ProjectPolly aims to simplify this by allowing people to make an informed decision based on a politician's characteristics,
promises made and politician views.

## Features

### Characteristics

Users can rate politicians based on 5 characteristics:

1. Trustworthy 
2. Accountable
3. Empathetic
4. Knowledgeable
5. Respectful

Which is then aggregated and displayed on a radar chart.

### Promises

Users can add promises a politician has made and vote on whether this promise has been:

* Achieved
* Partially Achieved
* Broken

### Views

Users can add any political views a politician has been made.

### User Voting System

Users can up or down vote other users contributions so that quality content floats to the top (kind of like StackExchange).

### Google, Facebook and Twitter sign in 

Users can sign in with the typical email/password or they can sign in with their Google, Facebook or Twitter accounts.

### Mobile first UI (Bootstrap)

Built using bootstrap meaning that pages look great on all devices. 

## Technologies Used

* Node.js
* Pugjs
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* Passport.js
* Chart.js
* Bootstrap 
* Twitter API (for retrieving politician's profile picture)
